# bootstrap4base
Just a quick ready-to-code base with Bootstrap v4.0.0.
Nothing fancy, but might be useful for someone.

I used Gulp to make tasks like browser-sync and gulp-sass, also included font-awesome, basic boostrap.min.js and bootstrap.scss.
Feel free to use it. I know I will.

# How to use?
1. Clone or download repo to your desktop.
2. Open Terminal/PowerShell.
3. Write `npm install` command to download all node_modules folder.
4. Write `gulp` command to open project in browser with browserSync.
5. Have fun.
